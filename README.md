# RCNN-A-Better-Model-for-Biological-Object-Recognition
Here I have used RCNN with Bottom-up(B), Lateral(L), and top-down(T) connections. Combining these three types of connections yield four architectures( B, BT, BL, BLT) and two extra BF and BK models also tested and evaluated. We hypothesize that Recurrent dynamics improve the recognition performance in challenging conditions.
