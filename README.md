# RCNN-A-Better-Model-for-Biological-Object-Recognition
Implements the part of research paper: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01551/full.

I have used the Cifar-10 dataset to compare the performaces of recurrent convolutional neural networks with bottom-up (B), lateral (L), and top-down (T) connections with that of the conventional CNN(feed-forward) model, and also the two varients of these feedforward model.
